Write and publish a blog post with responses to the following:

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?
3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

7. How was this study funded?
8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

## Answers:

The Research paper I found and decided to use was "**Reassessing the value of nursery areas to shark conservation and management**" (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00046.x), which analyses the importance of protecting shark nusery areas in protecting shark populations, and the level of importance as compared to protecting more mature sharks outside of nurseries.

### Question
1.  What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

### Explanation
After reading the research paper it would seem that the null hypothesis is that their is little to no effect in the conservation of shark populations from protecting shark nursery areas. The alternative hypothesis would then be that presevation and protection of shark nursery areas does have a large affect and great importance in the conservation of shark populations as a whole.

### Question
2.  Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

### Explanation
The author of this Research Paper are Michael John Kinney & Colin Ashley Simpfendorfer of Fishing and Fisheries Research Centre, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia. They are working for a research centre whose focus is on fish and fisheries (so the impact of commercial fishing included) of a university.
