## Tasks
Task

5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?
6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?
7. How was this study funded?
8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

## Answers:

The Research paper I found and decided to use was "**Reassessing the value of nursery areas to shark conservation and management**" (Kinney, M.J. and Simpfendorfer, C.A. (2009), Reassessing the value of nursery areas to shark conservation and management. Conservation Letters, 2: 53-60. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00046.x), which analyses the importance of protecting shark nusery areas in protecting shark populations, and the level of importance as compared to protecting more mature sharks outside of nurseries.

### Question
1.  What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

### Explanation
After reading the research paper it would seem that the null hypothesis is that their is little to no effect in the conservation of shark populations from protecting shark nursery areas. The alternative hypothesis would then be that presevation and protection of shark nursery areas does have a large affect and great importance in the conservation of shark populations as a whole.

### Question
2.  Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

### Explanation
The author of this Research Paper are Michael John Kinney & Colin Ashley Simpfendorfer of Fishing and Fisheries Research Centre, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia. They are working for a research centre whose focus is on fish and fisheries (so the impact of commercial fishing included) of a university.

### Question
4. Why are they interested in this data?

### Explanation

The data sets and research papers are mostly used to make observations of certain facts or known information without having to go out of the way to physically ascertain every piece of information. Data sets are used to show or represent certain qualities, aspects or impacts of shark nurseries in connection with the paper's own argument. The paper makes analysis on some data sets to extrapolate information for its argument. They are interested in how a multitude of different factors affects shark populations and nurseries.

### Question
6. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

### Explanation
Data being recorded is on captured and tagged sharks, and sharks found within nursery areas. The term of 'shark nursery' is not an extremely tight definition, and the included areas considered to be 'shark nurseries' is still expanding and changing. Therefore shark analysis in these areas may struggle to represent the whole of shark nurseries as the included areas are expanding, and the sharks within also. Shark nurseries are also extremely diverse so giving one general overall data sample of shark populations within nurseries is not viable, instead a specific species and/or genus of shark is used. This presents the issue of deciding which types of sharks are being represented. Another problem is that outside ofnurseries, concerning adult and non-juvinile sharks, it is much harder to collect data on them, as they are spread throughout large, open oceans. Sharks that are represented are sharks that have been captured andd tagged, which could exclude sharks that live in different areas, depths, travel away from the sounds of the boats that are trying to tag them, bias of where tagging teams travel to and from, among other problems.

### Question
8. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

### Explanation
They presented data from research papers on the effect that preservation of young (loggerhead and green)turtle populations in boosting or assisting older turtle populations. From these papers they extrapolated towards sharks and their nurseries. They also used other papers that considered similar ideas to theirs, considering their determinations of action into the conclusion

### Question
10. How was this study funded?

### Explanation
The authors come from Fishing and Fisheries Research Centre, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, James Cook University, so I believe it likely that they were funded by James Cook University, though also likely from the publication as well. James Cook University seems to put a decent focus on the protection and preservation of wildlife and nature, so the study likely in part originated due to the university's already existing placement of importance on it.

### Question
12. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

### Explanation
While publish or perish likely had some effect, I believe that it did not have that big of an effect. This paper is not a novel research paper. Similar papers have been written on the topic of shark nurseries, both on different aspects of shark nurseries, as well as on the same issue of the importance of their conservation. Even within itself, the article discusses other papers that talk about the same issue that this paper discusses, and tries to view those papers in relation to other papers and research.
