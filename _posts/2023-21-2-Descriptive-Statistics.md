## Objectives
This lab is intended to evaluate your ability to:
. prepare a dataset for analysis
. calculate summary statistics for a dataset
. describe the distribution of a variable
. analyze associations between variables
. statistically describe a dataset with supporting evidence

## Task
Find a dataset on a topic that you are interested in. You will be writing a Python program (or notebook) to analyze this dataset. This time, you will try to draw conclusions about the dataset based on your analysis of summary statistics. You do not have to analyze every attribute of the entire dataset! You are welcome to analyze smaller sections of the dataset that youʼre interested in. Write a blog post for your website with responses to the following:
. Which dataset did you work with?
. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?
. Discuss your analysis of the dataset. Include details such as:
. The variables you looked at
. Distributions of variables (center and variability)
. Relationships between variables
. Visualizations of the dataset
. Limitations of your analysis and the dataset
. What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence? Your blog post should showcase your understanding of the material covered in this unit.

## Academic Honesty
You are allowed to work with others on this lab, as long as you do not share any code or files! Please refer to
the syllabus for more details.
You are allowed to use modules we havenʼt talked about in class, as long as they are cited, and in your blog
post you include an explanation of how and why they are used.

## Answers:

### Question:
1. Which dataset did you work with?

### Answer:
I worked with the NYC accidents 2020 dataset

### Question:
2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?

### Answer:
I was interested in finding connection and correlations in NYC crashes. Initially I had wanted to do a dataset concerning traffic flow in NYC but after struggling to find one that was suitable and spanned over more than a few days, I went with the NYC crash dataset. I was interested principally in learning what factors might see an increase in crashes, such as location, vehicle type, or time of day, and what might correlate with an increase in injury/death.

### Analysis:

The clearest graphable connection is the number of crashes compared to the time of day.

### Code:
{% highlight python linenos %}

{% endhighlight %}
