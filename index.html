title: Art of Data - Arun Lal
subtitle: This website displays the projects for my high school 'Art of Data' Class focused on data analysis. Each page is formatted with either tasks or explanations included, and displays written answers, code and diagrams. The 'Dinosaur Plane' project involved coming up with our own imaginary problem and then using data to consider it, present it to the whole class. I based the project on the 'What If' book. The only edits made to this webpage since the class is here in the header/explanation, in the links at the top and bottom of this home page, and the small description linked in 'about me'.
